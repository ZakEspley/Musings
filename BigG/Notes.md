# Gravitational Constant (Big G)

## Timeline

### Nature Paper

I started by reading an paper in Nature about a recent measurement the gravitational force using two 90mg masses. This was an incredible feat that they performed.

Basically, they built a modified Cavendish experiment using two gold bb's with a diameter of just 2mm each. Through some advanced techniques, they were able to detect the gravitational attraction between the two bb's.

This force is so small that just having a person in the room is enough to through off the experiment. This was done at the University of Vienna and there apparatus was even effected by the tram that would run 50m away. They had to do it over winter break, when all the students were gone, things were still, and trams weren't running, to even see the attraction.

The main point of the paper was about being able to detect the gravitational attraction between the two bb's but they did end up quoting a measurement for the gravitational constant, also referred to as "Big G".

One thing I thought was interesting was that their measured value of Big G had a percent discrepancy of 9% from the accepted value, BUT, their uncertainty in the measurement contained the actual value of Big G, so all seemed fine.

This got me wondering how a sophisticated experiment like this was so far off from the accepted value. If that is the case, how is the accepted value for Big G measured? How well do we know it?

Well, it turns out that the answer is actually that we don't know the value of Big G all that well. We really only know it to about 3 significant figures. The measurement for Big G actually has been measured to be quite a few different values throughout history, and not all of them converge on agreement.

## Brainstorm

- Change hook above?
- What is Big G
- Why is it hard to measure?
- Talk about Cavendish (first to measure it)
- Talk about other historical ways G has been measured.
- Talk about modern measurements of G.
- Crisis in G and what is being done?
