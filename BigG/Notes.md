# Gravitational Constant (Big G)

## Timeline

### Nature Paper

I started by reading an paper in Nature about a recent measurement the gravitational force using two 90mg masses. This was an incredible feat that they performed.

Basically, they built a modified Cavendish experiment using two gold bb's with a diameter of just 2mm each. Through some advanced techniques, they were able to detect the gravitational attraction between the two bb's.

This force is so small that just having a person in the room is enough to through off the experiment. This was done at the University of Vienna and there apparatus was even effected by the tram that would run 50m away. They had to do it over winter break, when all the students were gone, things were still, and trams weren't running, to even see the attraction.

The main point of the paper was about being able to detect the gravitational attraction between the two bb's but they did end up quoting a measurement for the gravitational constant, also referred to as "Big G".

One thing I thought was interesting was that their measured value of Big G had a percent discrepancy of 9% from the accepted value, BUT, their uncertainty in the measurement contained the actual value of Big G, so all seemed fine.

This got me wondering how a sophisticated experiment like this was so far off from the accepted value. If that is the case, how is the accepted value for Big G measured? How well do we know it?

Well, it turns out that the answer is actually that we don't know the value of Big G all that well. We really only know it to about 3 significant figures. The measurement for Big G actually has been measured to be quite a few different values throughout history, and not all of them converge on agreement.

## Brainstorm

- Change hook above?
- What is Big G
- Why is it hard to measure?
- Talk about Cavendish (first to measure it)
- Talk about other historical ways G has been measured.
- Talk about modern measurements of G.
- Crisis in G and what is being done?
- What is the Birge Ratio?

## Big G Controversy Notes
From this [article](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/11/big-g-redux-solving-mystery-perplexing-result)

The gravitational constant is only known to three sig figs while something like the mass of an electron is known to 8. (Maybe check current values)


> Furthermore, as G measurements become more and more sophisticated, rather than converging on a single value, the results diverge maddeningly from each other, with error bars that do not generally overlap.

Bureau of Weights and Measurements (BIPM) had two values of G that did not agree with convention. They decided to have two teams use the same equipment to try to reproduce the results. In an attempt to eliminate systematic error.

To measure G with modern torrision pendulum they need to know the mass and geometry of the every mass extremely accurately. To do this they use a machine called a coordinate measuring machine. This device is a set on a huge granite slab and can measure distances between points on an object up to 0.5 nm uncertainty.

## Trouble with Capital G Notes
From this [article](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2014/10/trouble-capital-g)

NIST is was to setup annual or biannual meeting to figure out the problem with G.

##Measurements of the Newtonian constant of gravitiation, G
From this [article](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4994619)

Over 200 measurements have been performed since Cavendish in attempts to measure G.

> The uncertainty of G is based on the measurement precision reported by the experimenters, but it also includes a factor of 6.3 in order to take into account the large spread between the values obtained by different groups.

> The field is definitely far removed from the intellectual phase locking6 that has occurred in the past in the context of measuring other fundamental constants of nature.7

Cavendish did not orginally measure G. This was not a thing at the time of Newton or Cavendish. Physical laws were expressed as ratios so the constant did not matter to Newton or Cavendish. What Cavendish did measure however was mean density of the Earth.

> He calibrated the density of the field masses with respect to a reference material (water). Then, he measured the attraction of the test masses with respect to these field masses. As a result, he was able to give a ratio between the field masses and the Earthâ€™s mass. As the diameter of the Earth was already known, he was able to derive its mean density.

Figure 2 is very good for show the uncertainties in other constants.

It is very difficult and not cost effective to measure G in a satellite in space. There is one currently planned call Satellite Energy Exchange (SEE)

Outside of a torsion pendulum there are a few other ways to measure G:

- Microgravity Environment
- Free Fall Method
- Beam Balance
- Simple pendulum

The beam balance is done by putting two equal masses on a balance and then a field mass underneath one of the masses on the balance adding an extra gravitational field.This will put the balance out of equilibrium. Sometimes the counter force is created electrically. One issue with this method is that the gravity from the Moon and the SUn (tidal forces)  have to be taken into account.

Simple pendula can be used in two ways. One is by measuring little g from the period and backing out G. The other is to bring a field mass close to the bob and look at the deflection.

This paper is excellent for going into great detail about the different way apparatus are used to measure  G. It does not talk much about controversy however. Maybe this is a good way to talk about a few of the ways G is measured.
